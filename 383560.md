### PR: **dumebiumezinne_assignment_10**

#### **PS Screenshots for IQBs and deliverables included in Deployment.md**

- #### a. Instructions to evaluate the work done and explain the deliverables.

        - Login to vcenter.aureacentral.com,  check "VMs and Templates" to see the correctly named VM, dumebiumezinne_assignment_10, is running in the L2Remotecamp-Dev folder. Take note of the Server IP.

        - IIS Binding: Navigate to http://10.26.6.x and the IIS default landing page opens.

        - Tomcat: Navigate to http://10.26.6.x:8080 and the Tomcat Web UI page opens.

        - HRMS Application: Navigate to http://10.26.6.x/lbp and the application login page opens.

        - HRMS Application User Login: test the login via a UDL test or the SQL Server Managment Studio with SQL Authentication login details:

           - Login: "lbp_nvsuperuser1" *(the application converts to this when "nvsuperuser1" is entered from the web login.)*
           - Password: "nuview"
           - SQL Server: NUVIEW-DEMO\SQL2012
           - Database: NuLBP

           Check the SQL Server logs to confirm the login is successful.


- #### b. Assumptions you have made.
        The application does not send the exact login information typed into the browser to the SQL server. There is an intermediary code/function/service that appends/alters the login details typed into the browser before sending it to the SQL Server.

- #### c. Any requirements not covered in your submission. This is very important.
        Application web login was unsuccessful. However, connection to the SQL database using same login credentials, i.e. user = "lbp_nvsuperuser1" | password = "nuview", is successful.

- #### d. Any issues you have faced while completing the assignment.
        N/A

- #### e. Constructive feedback for improving the assignment. For example, how to better test the same skill set with a shorter test.
        - For testing ports and IP address settings, packet capture analysis using Wireshark, tcpdump, etc can be used.
